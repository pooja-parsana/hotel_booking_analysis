# hotel_booking_analysis
In this project the hotel booking data set is explored.
This data set contains booking information 
for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and 
includes information such as when the 
booking was made, length of stay, the 
number of adults, children, and/or babies, 
and the number of available parking spaces, 
among other things.
